Form :
I created a new form under name of FrmIssuedOnReplacement.


Table :
ReplaceMain
ReplaceDetail

SP:

InsertUpdateReplaceMain
InsertUpdateReplaceDetail
DeleteReplaceMain
DeleteReplaceDetail


Type in IGL is "Issued On Replacement"
So please add this thing inside all the queries of the sale form and IGL related queries.

Hey that DGOk and DGEtc both should be added in damages Grid and Detail Table too.


Hey I made the changes you had made for only IGL Table and SP in my database.
